            <h2>Hello, there.</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>When I was young, I was taught to take pride in two things. Penmanship and mowing. “NEVER blow the first two passes towards the house”. I remember hearing that clear as a bell.  I’ve always enjoyed lawn work. I like taking a lawn that looks as if it’s too far gone and bringing it back to something amazing. Our goal is simple. Provide the highest quality lawn care possible at a fair price, an be easy to do business with. Give us the opportunity to take your lawn to next level.</p>
            <p>When we bought our first house, the grass in the lawn was at least three feet tall. It was like a jungle.</p>
            <p>The house was small (700 sq ft) and the yard was small, but it was ours. We spent a day mowing, raking, mowing again, and raking again, and so on and so forth. We finally had a yard… kind of.  We sprayed for broadleaf and turned the yard yellow. Soon though it looked like something a young married couple could be proud of. That was over 30 years ago. </p>
            <p>For the last 30 plus years, I have worked in the industrial gas/welding supply world. For the last 12 years, I worked as an executive with the title of Vice President of Sales. I managed several sales and technical employees and I loved it. And then I quit…</p>
            <p>Crazy, right? Leaving a high paying job to mow? To do something I love doing? But is it really crazy? To you, maybe it is. To me, it’s my dream job. Crazy, right?</p>
            <p>I finally came to the realization that as long as I was working for someone else, I was making their dreams come true, but not necessarily mine. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed my job and my coworkers, but in the back of my head I always asked myself “is this what you really want to do?”</p>
            <p>Every house we have ever lived in (regardless if we owned it or rented it) we took great pride in the lawn. I applied broadleaf control and fertilizer on every single property. I took care of the lawn and my wife (Lisa) beautified the property with flowers and hanging baskets (another service we are considering). </p>
            <p>I mentioned Lisa, my wife. She has an eye for flowers, hanging baskets, and that general “front porch” first impression that people see when they drive by your house. She has always been like this. That first little house we owned had the most amazing flowers and baskets you could ever imagine.</p>
            <p>Lisa and I? Well, we met in the lunch line in Mrs. Fords class in fourth grade. She said it was love at first sight, and I followed her lead. We were high school sweethearts attending every dance (well, the dances that her dad would let her attend) and prom our junior and senior year of high school.</p>
            <p>We were married in December of 1989 (and it was ridiculously cold). We have three wonderful boys (Curtis and Elliyah, Conner and Madisyn, and Colin and Shekinah). Why am I sharing this part? Because they are such an important part of the story.</p>
            <p>So, that’s us. We are your somewhat typical midwestern family. We take so much pride in this business and we want you to experience that pride with every job we do for you. The pride definitely shows through in the finished product.</p>
            <p>Our goal is simple. Provide the highest quality lawn care possible at a fair price, an be easy to do business with. This is why we offer online appointment booking and online bill pay.</p>
            <p>Give us the opportunity to take your lawn to next level. We do not require a contract for residential service and your first service is at no charge. We looking forward to being your lawn care solutions provider.</p>
