        <p>
          <strong>It’s been a year of changes. </strong> Many changes. So where
          did we come from, or how did we get here?
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last 30+ years, I have been in the industrial manufacturing
          world. My heart has always been in sales. I love the communication
          part and the community part of sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started out my career as a welder. It was HARD work. I spent some
          summers under a welding hood in heavy leathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those early years really developed who I am… my work ethic. Those
          years shaped me as a person. Those years provided for my wife and I
          and our very young family. For a period of time, I was working nights
          and she was working days. Sometimes on my way to work I wold pass her
          on the highway on her way home from work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually took a job in sales with a different company. I dove in
          head first. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I did it. Yes, I made
          some mistakes along the way, but I also had some success. Those
          successes really inspired me and created a drive in me to succeed that
          I can’t explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s jump ahead about 30 years. I had moved up from second shift
          welder to Vice President of Sales. I was fortunate to have many good
          employees. I learned from them until the day I left the company and I
          am eternally grateful for what they taught me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re saying “you were the VP and you were learning from people
          that worked for you?” Yes, that’s true. Don’t limit your education to
          books. Utilize your environment and those around you. Open your mind
          to all possibilities. I learned some things the easy way and some
          things the hard way. Oddly enough, I always go back to the “hard way”
          lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why did I leave that world? Yeah, I was making very good money. For
          the most part I was “happy”. I had deep respect for my employees and I
          cared for them deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that being said, the stress level was unbearable. I needed a
          change in my life. I was making horrible decisions and I knew that I
          had to change my path. What ever the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a matter of weeks I said “I can’t live like this anymore”. One of
          the factors in this decision was a conversation I had with my best
          friend. I remember telling him this crazy idea for starting a lawn
          care business. Much to my surprise, he told me that he thought it was
          a great idea and if I decided to do it, he would be my first customer.
          About six months later he told me that he was so happy for me and he
          also told me that he was concerned. He said “I’m not sure if would
          have still been here if you wouldn’t have made this change”. That
          really burnt in deep. I knew, but didn’t want to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          I left the life I knew. My wife, family, and friends fully supported
          me. And yes, it was terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started the season with six mowing customers. My expectation was to
          have 15 - 20 customers by the end of the year. At the end of our first
          mowing season, we are at nearly 100 clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our entire mindset for the business was to be the best at what we do,
          and to be easy to do business with. We wanted the properties to look
          great and and we wanted our customers experience to be easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of our son Curtis, we developed a website, a Google
          presence, and a CRM that allowed customers to not only make online
          payments, but to request proposals online. Going into this, we did not
          realize how much our customers would appreciate this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an interesting industry. My competition is not only the
          corporate company that has unlimited resources, but it’s also the 14
          year old kid that pulls a wagon and a push mower yard to yard. We
          decided early that we will not be the cheapest. We also will not be
          that company that comes in and is done in 15 minutes. It’s simply not
          our business model. When we finish a yard, people will know that we
          were the company that did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is our growth plan? Well, this winter we are doing snow removal.
          We are nearly at the point that we can not take on any additional
          customers. This part of our business has grown to a level that has
          exceeded our expectations. For that, we are truly thankful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next spring we will be offering full lawn treatment services
          (fertilizer and weed control). We will be expanding the lawn care side
          of the business to other communities (when it makes sense). What do I
          mean by that? Let me tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through out may career, I had a very strong focus on “Cost to Serve”.
          Simply put, what does it cost me to service a customer? What is the
          level of net profit that I find acceptable?
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a difficult question when you start a business. When you’re new,
          and starving, you hate to walk away from anything. That being said,
          the single best thing you can do as business owner is to know when to
          walk away.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are moving into this next phase of our business very methodically.
          We are looking to add people and assets. Up to this point, we have
          been very fortunate to do every thing debt free. Although many would
          say that’s the only way to do business, it really is not practical.
          Our potential growth has exceeded our current capacity to fund it.
          Actually what I should say is it has exceeded our potential for future
          growth and plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          My life has taken a drastic change in the last six months. My desire
          has always been to be the first choice to my customers, and my
          community. That will continue to be our focus moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will continue to do the stuff. The mowing, and the snow removal. We
          will also continue to do the lawn rehab (the pimp my lawn stuff).
          Besides the lawn treatment plans, we are looking at other
          opportunities as well. Those opportunities might include what we call
          “porch appeal” where we come to your house and design and place
          flowers, hanging baskets, and what ever it takes to add the “wow”
          factor to your house. One additional offering we are looking at is
          holiday lighting. We will share more details on this as we dive deeper
          into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, who are we? I can tell you this. We are far more than your typical
          “lawn care” company. We offer unmatched quality when it comes to your
          property. We guarantee your satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But who are we really? We are just a husband and wife who eventually
          had enough of the corporate life and decided to make a difference.
          That difference might be in the way you view your property. That
          difference is also in how we live our life. Doing something we truly
          love doing. Being a company that is easy to do business with.
          Beautifying properties one stripe at a time.
